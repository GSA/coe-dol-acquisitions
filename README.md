## GSA, DOL Partner in Centers of Excellence Initiative

**February 13, 2020**

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. General Services Administration and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) are entering into a partnership, as part of GSA’s Centers of Excellence (CoE) initiative, housed within the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) office. This newest CoE engagement will accelerate the modernization of DOL’s acquisition capabilities using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) expertise, a part of GSA’s newly formed Artificial Intelligence (AI) CoE. It will also position these capabilities to be scaled throughout the Department as a shared service.

The partnership will combine expertise from both DOL’s business units and TTS’ AI CoE in a model that empowers agencies to own their path to modernization.

“This latest engagement reflects the continued success of the Centers of Excellence initiative,” said White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Coordination Chris Liddell. “This is another positive development for the long-term institutional capacity of the Federal government to modernize its use of the latest technologies. Ultimately, this is a shared mission that will create a more efficient, effective and accountable government for all Americans.”

“GSA is happy to announce our new CoE engagement with the Department of Labor,” said GSA Administrator Emily Murphy. “This partnership is an example of GSA playing a key role in governmentwide IT modernization. Leveraging the expertise of our Technology Transformation Services, we will assist in identifying RPA opportunities for design and implementation.”

“The Department of Labor is always looking for ways to integrate new technologies into our operations,” U.S. Deputy Secretary of Labor Patrick Pizzella said. “By partnering with GSA, our Department will modernize our procurement process to better serve the taxpayers.”

“We’re excited to partner with DOL as the CoE efforts continue to grow. We’re eager to hone in on the specific challenges faced by the Department to achieve solutions that meet their needs, but are also repeatable and scalable,” said TTS Director Anil Cheriyan. “Our main focus is on improving outcomes for our agency partners and we’re pleased to serve as a catalyst to help them develop a culture of innovation. Robotics Process Automation in combination with Artificial Intelligence capabilities is gaining momentum in government, and is a strategic focus area for TTS this year.”

The Department of Labor is the sixth agency to partner with GSA and apply the CoE approach to modernization. The CoE is currently working with partners at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the U.S. Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.

The Centers of Excellence, a signature initiative of the administration, was designed by the White House’s Office of American Innovation and implemented at GSA in 2017. As part of GSA’s Technology Transformation Services, the CoE initiative accelerates IT modernization at federal agencies by leveraging private sector innovation and government services while centralizing best practices and expertise for holistic transformation. TTS helps agencies make their services more accessible, efficient, and effective with modern applications, platforms, processes, personnel, and software solutions.
